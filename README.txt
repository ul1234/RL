# RL
Use PyTorch to implement Reinforcement learning (Q learning, Policy gradient, Actor Critic) to solve CartPole in gym

The method implemented are:
1) Random
2) Hill climbing
3) Q-learning (include DQN, Double DQN, Noisy DQN, Multi-step DQN)
4) Policy gradient (include vanilla Policy gradient, Furture rewards Policy gradient)
5) Actor Critic (include Monte Carlo based and Time Difference based)
